    question: "What is Davenport Wardrobe?",
    answer:
      "Davenport Wardrobe is a modern menswear platform that gives you access to high-quality clothing without traditional ownership. You wear what you need, when you need it — without clutter or commitment.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does it work?",
    answer:
      "You select clothing from a rotating wardrobe curated with the help of AI. Pieces are delivered to your doorstep, worn on your terms, and returned or kept as pricing adjusts with wear over time.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does AI help?",
    answer:
      "Our system suggests outfits based on your lifestyle, preferences, and past selections. You stay in control — the AI simply narrows your options and evolves with your style.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this sustainable?",
    answer:
      "Yes. By extending the lifecycle of garments and reducing unnecessary production, Davenport Wardrobe helps lower textile waste and overproduction while maintaining premium quality.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who is this for?",
    answer:
      "Davenport Wardrobe is built for students, young professionals, and anyone who values flexibility, efficiency, and refined style without excess ownership.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I have to store clothes?",
    answer:
      "No. Since pieces rotate through the system, you avoid long-term storage, seasonal packing, and clutter — saving space and time.",
  },
  {
    question: "When are you launching?",
    answer:
      "We’re currently refining the platform. You can join the waitlist on the homepage to get early access and updates.",
  },
